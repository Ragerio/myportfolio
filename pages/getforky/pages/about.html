            <p>John S. Procaccini is a partner of the GRETALIA Hospitality Group in Princeton New Jersey—He received his B.S in Management and Organizational Behavior and a Concentration in Entrepreneurship
              from Rider University before eventually becoming the Director of International Operations at the Sarnoff Corporation (formerly RCA). In this capacity, John traveled extensively around the globe while simultaneously immersing himself in many different cultures.
              With this, John’s passion for food and hospitality was born, and decided to leave the corporate world and focus solely on the restaurant business.  He is married with two children and resides in Hopewell, New Jersey.

        <h2>GRETALIA</h2>
          <p>
            A restaurant management and consulting company formed in 2011 with heritage and hospitality of its GREEK and ITALIAN founders.  Creating “GRE-TALIA”.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summer of 2011, GRETALIA took operation of the original and legendary Pj’s Pancake House, located in Princeton, New Jersey.  GRETALIA expanded Pj’s from a breakfast focused restaurant, to a full-service restaurant, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner,
            paving the way for future expansion. There are currently five Pj’s Pancake Houses, Taverns and a Bakery location throughout New Jersey, with more scheduled to open in the near future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summer of 2012, Osteria Procaccini in Pennington opened offering authentic Italian traditional foods in a casual kitchen, using the freshest, all-natural, organic ingredients when available, and the time-honored method of terra cotta oven cooking.
            Artisan pizzas, handmade pastas, salads and specialty dishes made with quality hand-selected ingredients, are prepared with a passion for excellence that we know you will appreciate. No artificial preservatives, or additives, just good old fashioned,
            traditionally prepared Italian food with love. Done in a sustainable way, just as it should be. In 2014 a second location was born in the historic village of Crosswicks, New Jersey.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Winter of 2015, Trattoria Procaccini in Princeton opened offering our family’s favorite meals from Italy, in a more upscale kitchen. Using natural, organic ingredients, we cook delicious Italian dishes, with specials based on the season, using goods from local merchants and growers.
            A delightful array of pizza, fresh salads, handmade pastas, Italian specialties, soups and fresh baked bread make Trattoria the spot in Princeton to get away from the regular and enjoy a plate, just like Nonna made for us, in the comfort of our home away from home.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016, Porta Via was established with the idea of incorporating all of our concept’s unique menu offerings to our customers through a catering company.  Porta Via is the Italian way to say
            “take out.” Food that’s fast, yet freshly made with all-natural and locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible. Now, quick is healthful— and delicious.  Porta Via even caters for any occasion and can provide full service staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            GRETALIA always looking to expand their portfolio and with their passion for great BBQ, in 2019, looked for the best and partnered with More Than Q Barbeque Co. which was founded in 2014 by pitmaster Matt Martin, one of the East Coast’s top barbeque destinations, serving up delicious,
            smoked meats along with seasonal, southern sides. From brisket to smoked sausage, ribs, burnt end baked beans, collard greens, cheesy grits and more, our food is topped only by our outstanding customer service. We use only fresh, seasonal ingredients and select cuts of meat, making our
            delicious Texas-style BBQ the perfect barbeque experience. There are currently three locations in Easton, PA, Newhope PA, and Princeton, NJ with more locations scheduled to open in the near future.
